// Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three
// employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as follows:
package Que5;

class Employee {
    String name;
    int yoj;
    int salary;
    String address;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        a.name = "Robert";

        a.address = "64C- WallsStreet";
        Employee b = new Employee();
        b.name = "Sam";
        b.yoj = 2000;
        b.address = "64D- WallsStreet";
        Employee c = new Employee();
        c.name = "John";
        c.yoj = 1999;
        c.address = "26B- WallsStreet";
        System.out.println("Name" + "\t" + "Year of joining" + "\t" + "Address");
        System.out.println(a.name + "\t" + a.yoj + "\t" + a.address);
